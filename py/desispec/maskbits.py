=================

Mask bits for the spectro pipeline.

Stephen Bailey, LBNL, January 2015

Example::

    from desispec.maskbits import ccdmask

    #- bit operations
    mask |= ccdmask.COSMIC     #- set ccdmask.COSMIC in integer/array `mask`
    mask & ccdmask.COSMIC      #- get ccdmask.COSMIC from integer/array `mask`
    (mask & ccdmask.COSMIC) != 0  #- test boolean status of ccdmask.COSMIC in integer/array `mask`
    ccdmask.COSMIC | specmask.SATURATED  #- Combine two bitmasks.

    #- bit attributes
    ccdmask.mask('COSMIC')     #- 2**0, same as ccdmask.COSMIC
    ccdmask.mask(0)            #- 2**0, same as ccdmask.COSMIC
    ccdmask.COSMIC             #- 2**0, same as ccdmask.mask('COSMIC')
    ccdmask.bitnum('COSMIC')   #- 0
    ccdmask.bitname(0)         #- 'COSMIC'
    ccdmask.names()            #- ['COSMIC', 'HOT', 'DEAD', 'SATURATED', ...]
    ccdmask.names(3)           #- ['COSMIC', 'HOT']
    ccdmask.comment(0)         #- "Cosmic ray"
    ccdmask.comment('BADPIX')  #- "Cosmic ray"
