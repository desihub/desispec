"""
desispec.tpcorrparam
====================

This module implements a model for how the throughput of a fiber varies.

It has the following components:

1. We find that the fibers don't follow the nighly flat field exactly, and
   apply a fixed mean correction from the nightly flat field.  This is thought
   to reflect the different range of angles entering the fiber from the flat
   field relative to the sky.
2. We find that fibers' throughput depends modestly on the fibers' location
   within their patrol radii.  We apply a cubic polynomial in (x, y) within
   the patrol disk to correct for this.
3. We find additional coherent variations in throughput from exposure to
   exposure.  These are modeled with a PCA and fit exposure-by-exposure.

The TPCorrParam object has mean, spatial, and pca attributes describing
each of these three components.
