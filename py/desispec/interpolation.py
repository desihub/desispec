This is a comment, not a code documentation

A rigorous resampling requires using the resolution matrix, solving
a linear system, and redetermining the new resolution matrix.
This is implemented in the co-addition but the following routine
is intended to be fast.

Another approach, which is also time consuming is the following :

    - input and output are interpreted as with a basis of functions,
    where xin(out) are the barycenter of each function and play the role
    of indices, and yin(out) the amplitudes
    - y(x) = sum_i y_i * f_i(x)
    for a simple binning :
    - f_i(x) =  (x_{i-1}+x_{i})/2<x<=(x_{i}+x_{i+1})/2
    for higher orders, their exists an equivalent f_i(x)
    - the uncertainties on the y_i are given by ivar
    - it is not a spline fit because the input is not necessarily
    dense with respect to the output, so we need this approach

    calling f_i(x) the input basis, a_i, the input node values,
    and g_j(x) the output basis and b_j the output node values,
    a change of b, db, results in a change of a continuous function y(x) :
    dy(x) = g.db = sum_i db_i g_i(x)
    defining the scalar product f.g_{ij} = integral_x f_i(x)*g_j(x) dx
    the induced change of a is
    da = (f.f)^{-1} (f.g) db
    calling H the matrix (f.f)^{-1} (f.g)
    we can write a chi2 on the 'a' coefficents,
    chi2 = sum_i ivar_i ( a_i - sum_j H_ij b_j )**2
    the best fit b is given by the linear system
    A b = B
    where A_kl = sum_i ivar_i H_ik H_il
    and   B_k  = sum_i ivar_i a_i H_ik

    This is the general solution. It is more or less complex depending
    on the basis f and g.

    In many case, a minimal regularization would be needed.
    For instance if we rebin to a finer grid than the
    original.

    We consider a practical approach in the following.
